EventEcho - Event Feedback Analysis Dashboard

The Event Feedback Analysis Dashboard is a web-based platform developed to streamline the process of collecting, analyzing, and maintaining event feedback for the clubs of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai. It provides an organized, data-driven approach to understanding participant responses and measuring the overall success of events conducted by student clubs.

The system is designed to transform raw event feedback into meaningful insights through structured analysis and visualization. It highlights key aspects such as sentiment distribution, trending topics, and keyword analysis, while also providing an overall textual summary of participant opinions. Additionally, the platform evaluates engagement levels and compiles selected sample feedback for quick review. These insights help clubs identify areas of improvement and recognize strengths, ensuring that future events are planned with a participant-centric perspective.

The dashboard places special emphasis on accessibility and ease of interpretation. Information is presented in the form of charts, word clouds, and attractively designed cards to ensure that both qualitative and quantitative aspects of feedback are clear and actionable. An automated PDF report generation feature has also been integrated, enabling organizers to maintain well-documented records of event outcomes for future reference and reporting purposes.

This initiative not only enhances transparency and accountability within the clubs but also ensures that feedback management becomes a systematic process rather than an ad-hoc activity. By leveraging data analytics and modern web technologies, the Event Feedback Analysis Dashboard supports a culture of continuous improvement, fostering better engagement, inclusivity, and impact in the activities organized by the CSE clubs of TCE.
